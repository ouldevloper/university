# Advice

## Introduction

This is dedicated to my juniors in DCO, to help you (if you are a junior) to know what to prioritize, and avoid booby traps :bomb: and pitfalls.

## Difficulty Level

- Zero: Impossible to fail. Extremely easy A. But their presence means there's a larger threat just around the corner.
- One: Unlikely to fail. Very easy A. Spend minimal time on these.
- Two: Possible to fail. Easy A. Light revision. Practice the last year PYQ. 
- Three: Likely to fail. Manageable A. Go through entire tutorials at least once. Practice 2-3 sets PYQ.
- Four: Easy to fail. Difficult A. Go through entire notes/tutorials at least once. Practice 2-4 sets PYQ.
- Five: Very easy to fail. Very difficult A. Go through entire notes & tutorials at least once. Practice 3-4 sets PYQ.

## General

- **ALWAYS practice past year questions for mid-terms & finals.** I cannot stress this enough. PYQ are more important source of practice than notes & tutorials.
