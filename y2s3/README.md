### Marks

- 40% UC Supervisor: 2 monthly report + 1 final report
- 60% company supervisor
  - NOTE: **Know your rights**. Don't because of marks, become a doormat, get harassed, or anything that harms yourself physically and/or mentally. 
    - SPEAK UP to your UC supervisor / course rep. 
    - If your company threaten to fail you if you expose them,  speak up. The company will get threatened by UC to give you good marks, or, UC will FAIL THEM and give you good marks.
- Any action(s) deem illegal, immoral, inconsiderate or
  inappropriate. This applies to the company too, if they do this kind of stuff, they failed and you get good marks.

## Danger Matters :skull_and_crossbones:

### Instant fail stuff (without proper reason)

- Regardless of anything, students **CANNOT take > 6 days of leave** (paid + unpaid + whatever).
  - Requirement by MOHE, anything more = **FAIL**
- Leave without approval
- Always Late
- Did not submit monthly + final report
- Change internship dates with company without approval from UC

## What to do on X

### First Week

#### First Day

- Hand internship confirmation letter to company
  - **Internship letter is ready for collection**, I know, it is 1 day after we finish all exam only they announce, seriously....I need to travel 3 hours back and forth to get 1 letter.

#### Rest of Week

- Work, slack off, work, check classroom, slack off, go home.

### Reports

- Submit by deadline
- For report format: refer to 
  - Monthly report: FOCS_StudF03
  - Final report: FOCS_StudF04
- For supervisor, refer to: UC Supervisor-Student List

### Evaluation Forms

- Industrial Training Supervisor Evaluation on Student
  Form (the form to be used by UC Supervisor is
  FOCS_SupF01(D)) - This one can ignore
- Company Supervisor Evaluation on Student Form (the form to be used by Company Supervisor is **FOCS_EmpF03**).
  - Print out, give to supervisor
  - Ensure supervisor complete, and send to to UC supervisor not later than **24-Mar-2020**
