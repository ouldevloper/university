Make sure to put in name and id attributes to prevent mark deduction.

Take note, maxlength, size and placeholder

DONT confuse maxlength and size. Maxlength refers to the maximum length of text can be entered.

Selection list need to memorize, size and multiple selection (just take note)

Take note of `selected="selected"` abd `multiple="multiple"`

Last few years came out clickable radios. Put label code in front and behind
