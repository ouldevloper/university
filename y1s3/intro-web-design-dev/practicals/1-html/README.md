# Exercise: Basic HTML

This section of the webdev repository explains my work on basic HTML while studying at Tunku Abdul Rahman University College (TAR UC). 

All credits go to the authors of Cengage Learning, and also to TAR UC for the content. My only work is following the exercises and applying the appropriate changes to the files.
