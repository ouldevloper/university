# Exam Tips

- Mid term test until Chapter 5 Strings
- Mid term test covers:
  - Theory questions (including chapter 5)
  - Debugging programs (Tracing)
  - UML Class Diagram - convert to a Java class

Time: 

- **4:30-5:30 (DCO2)**
- 3:30-4:30 (DIA2)

Extra notes:

- Leave a space in between
- Bring stapler and test pad along

## Chapter 5

- Uppercase, lowercase, toLower, toUpper. String & character methods confirm will come out in mid term and finals. (According to tutorial teachers).

- Sure will test on String and StringBuilder/StringBuffer after modification.

## Lab test

 - no open book, no internet
During tutorial class - can do tutorial
Lab test - C4 -> C8
Will give UML diagram, very straightforward. (Worst case scenario: Practical 7)
How to put objects inside array
Note: if you try to stringify a class, then toString() will automatically run
 - Need to tell them what is the object class (which child class). Utilize instanceof 
 - If both class have same properties, most probably will have parent class
 - toString method, please remember to put labels (Eg: `"label: " + content`)
