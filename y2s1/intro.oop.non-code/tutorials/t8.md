# Tutorial 8 - OO Design Patterns

## UML Design (Final should come out, but no need too focus)

### Composition

- Strong relationship

### Aggregation

- Weak relationship

### Inheritance

- Parent/child
- Keyword is `extends`
  - `toString`
  - `equals`
  - `super`

### Association

- No direct relationship with other
- Two class, not related to each other
  - Example: Staff class and Customer. They are not really related

### Multiplicity

- 1..* (1 to many)
- 1 (1 to 1)



## Q1

What relationship is appropriate for the following classes? Depict your suggested relationships using UML diagrams and include the multiplicity between classes.

(a) Company, Department and Employee in a human resource (HR) company

## Q2

(a) The default constructor already define a name and ID for an instance. The `int` and `string` should be removed.

(b) The `totalMedal` is `static`, but each country can have different total medal.

(c) Line 8. `getGold()` should not be `static`. Line 11 `getCountCountry()` should be `static`.

### Q3

Create 4 classes. 

```java
public BankAccount() {
    protected String accountNo;
}

public FixedDeposit() {
    private double amount;
    private double interestRate;
}

public Customer() {
    private String ic;
    private Name name;
    private FixedDeposit[] fixedDeposits;
}

public Name() {
    private String lastName;
    private String firstName;
}
```

### Q4

```java

```
