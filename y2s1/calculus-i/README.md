## Files

There are three types of files in each directory that you might meet

- `.pdf`. **These are the ones you want**
- `.lyx`. These are the "source code" of the notes. If you want you can download a program called LyX to open and edit them.
- `.lyx~`. Might or might not be present. If you don't see them, they have been removed using `.gitignore`. But if you do, they are simply auto-created backup copies of the `.lyx` files in case I forgot to safe. Ignore them entirely.
