- Standby generator, computers.

## 2. Training

**Purpose:** Ensure they know how to use before implementation

- Facilitates user involvement
- Make user familiar with system
- Allow participation in implementation. Makes them understand system better.
- Opportunities to spot & correct errors.

### Methods of Training

#### Instructor based

- Involves instructor demonstrating skills & procedures

- **Advantages**: Easy to develop and conduct. Trainer expertise
- **Disadvantage**: Logistic arrangement, cost issues

#### Computer Based

- Provide on-demand training
- **Advantage:**
  - Usable anytime
  - Lower cost overtime
  - Tracking learning progress possible
- **Disadvantage:**
  - High initial cost, complexity.

#### Podcast & Webinars

##### Podcasts

- Web-based broadcast
- Advantages: accessible everywhere using portable devices

##### Webinars

- Web + seminar
- Types
  - **Interactive**: with instructor via Internet
  - **Non-interactive:** pre-recorded
- **Advantage:** Non-location specific, can attend anytime.

#### Self Training

- User manuals prepared for users to learn skills & knowledge
- **Advantage:** 
  - Easy to develop
  - Low initial investment 
  - Minimal logistic requirements
- **Disadvantage:**
  - Not effective
  - Difficult to control completion

#### Online Help / Tutorial

- Get help on-site
- **Advantage:** On-demand, adapts with user experience
- **Disadvantage:** High complexity, initial cost to develop

#### Case Study & Exercises

- Supplement classroom tuition and CBT
- **Advantages:** Simulate real environment, easy to produce, help user to understand

#### Outside or Public Training Resource

- Guidelines and training offered by hardware and software vendors to customers.

#### Internal / in-house training

- Organization conducting their own training
- **Advantages:**
  - Better control
  - Assessment on effectiveness can be easily done simultaneously

#### Vendor In-house Training

- Training arranged by software and hardware manufacturers
- **Advantages:**
  - Vendor can adapt training environment to match client's working environment
  - More flexible in terms of timetable and schedules
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Logistics arrangement completely depends on client.

### Delivering Effective Training

**Training objective**: Establish what we hope to achieve

**Training needs analysis**: Identify knowledge gap to bridge

**Course design:** Decide on duration, content, and teachers.

**Conduct training:** Make logistics arrangements, start training.

**Assessment:** Post-learning evaluation to measure effectiveness.

## 3. File Conversion & Creation

### Objective

- Produce file on intended medium.
- Produce error-free file.
- Ensure future operations are smooth.

### Data conversion

- **Meaning:** Convert old system data to match new system needs.
- **Data mapping:** Map data files to new system
- **Conversion routines:** Procedure to convert data from old to new format.

### Data creation

- **Meaning:** Create data in new system using creation routine and data entry.
- **Creation routines:** Manual data entry.
- **Data validation:** Check data before storing in system.

### Methods of converting data

- **Automated approach:** Conversion using software
  - **ODBC:** **O**pen **D**ata**b**ase **C**onnectivity
- **Manual approach:** Convert by manual data entry according to prescribed rules

### Data Conversion Problems (Automated)

#### Technical incompatibility between systems

- Hardware incompatibility might cause data be technically unfeasible to be converted.
  - **Solution**: Print out and enter back

#### Problems of new data fields

- Data fields not available on current system, new requirements

#### Problems of matching data fields

- No exact match between data fields. Data fields need to be combined/split up.

#### Problems of new data types

- New system have extra files. Need to determine appropriate values.

#### Problems of fields of different length

- Data with different field lengths need to be transferred

### Data conversion problems (manual)

#### 1. Resources to set up master files

- File creation can be difficult, complicated, especially in big companies with many divisions.
- Resources of department might be insufficient.

#### 2. Entry of System Derived fields

- Some derived fields are automatically set by programs, and cannot be entered manually.

#### 3. Lack of historical data, use restriction

- Reports designed to be made using information collected in interval might be little use until enough information is collected.

### File Conversion Plan

- Set time table for conversion.
- Carry dummy run.
- Decide on cut-off data.
- Training of staff.
- Run data validation.
- Plan for most efficient way.

## 4. System Conversion (Changeover)

### Parallel Run

![Parallel Running Picture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Parallel_running.png/350px-Parallel_running.png)

**Meaning:** Running old & new system simultaneously at same time.

- Same input, output are compared and errors are corrected.

- Old system is removed after new system proven satisfactory.

### Appropriate circumstances

**Large and risky systems**: System has high risk of failure

**Lack of confidence:** Little experience in overcoming failures

**Resources sufficient:** Enough resources.

**Comparable systems:** Old and new system similar purpose

### Advantages - Parallel Run

**Standby system:** Old system can backup new system on failure

**Verification:** Old and new outputs can be compared & verified.

**Promote user confidence:** User know have something to fallback.

**Consolidate training:** Relatable training, can be combined.

### Disadvantages - Parallel run

**High cost.** Running two systems together requires more resources.

**Cross-checking:** Difficulty, time-consuming to cross-check when output don't match

**Not comparable:** Cannot be used when system operates differently

**Risk of failure:** Attention split between two systems, opportunity cost can lead to personnel with weak skills in either system.

## 5. Direct Changeover 

**Meaning:** Select suitable cut-off date, stop the older system, and start the new system. Usually used when old system and new system is vastly different.

### Appropriate circumstances

- **Small system**
- **Competent staff**
- **Reliable systems**
- **Not comparable**
- **Resources shortage**

### Advantages

- Flexible changeover time
- Cheaper
- Maintain morale
- Quick return on investment

### Disadvantages

- Risky approach
- Organization and supervision costs
- Need comprehensive testing
- Difficult to detect errors

## 6. Pilot Run

**Meaning:** Test the new system on a "pilot branch", and deploying system on other branches after success. In "pilot branch", can use either direct changeover or parallel run.

### Appropriate circumstances

- Large systems project spanning wide range
- Resources shortage

### Advantages

- Localized errors
- Cheaper
- Reduce risk of failure
- Promote user confidence
- Prevent overstretching of resources

### Disadvantages

- Overwork of employees
- High investment
- Not full representative

## 7. Phased/Staged changeover

**Meaning:** Implement system in stages/phases. Divide the system into parts and introduce them one-by-one after the previous one succeeds.

### Advantages

- Less resources required
- Reduced risk
- Increase user confidence

### Disadvantages

- Slow process
- Demoralize staff. Having to deal with constant change.
- More expensive. Far longer active implementation period.
