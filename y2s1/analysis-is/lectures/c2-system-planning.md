## System Request

- A formal request for services of IS department 

### Need for System Request

- Change in organization's objective
- New objective

### Results of Request

- Enhancement of system
- Development of system

## Sources of System Request

1. Directives from top management
2. Existing System
3. User's needs
4. External sources
5. IS Department

*To memorize 4*: **eide**

*Mnemonic*: **D**ark **E**ngineers **U**nleashed **E**ggplants **I**nfamously.

## Types of Improvement Required

1. Improved performance
2. Better service
3. Quality information
4. Effective controls
5. Lower cost

*To memorize 4*: **Bile**: a bitter greenish-brown alkaline fluid which aids digestion and is secreted by the liver

*Mnemonic*: **I**ntelligent **B**aboons **Q**uizzed **E**legant **L**ambs

## Preliminary Investigation

Start after: project approved

Purpose: Gather information to know whether problems specified requires subsequent SDLC stages.

Areas involved:

- Investigating system requested
- Determine true nature and scope of problem

Output: **Preliminary Investigation Report** to management for recommendation.

## Feasibility Study

**Definition**:  A study to **determine** if new system is **feasible/practical & justifiable/sensible** (benefits > cost).

### Purpose

#### Identify:

- Objectives
- Constraints
- Requirements
- Scope of projects

#### Estimate:

- Cost and benefits
- Time requirements

*Memorize 4: COST*

*Mnemonic:* **C**lean **O**mnipotent **R**adios **S**erve **C**ute **T**ractors

##  Types of Feasibility Study (Note: Exam popular)

### Technical feasibility

- Concerns:
  - Specifying **hardware**, **software**, and **performance** requirements
  - Check whether **technically achievable**
- Issues:
  - Number of users
  - Data inputs
  - Response Times
  - Outputs

#### Social and operational feasibility

- Concerns:
  - project's ability to fit into existing social & operational structure.
  - additional costs / new benefits.
- Issues:
  - Employee skills
  - Employee motivation & resistance
  - Structural changes
  - High cost (training & development costs)

### Economic feasibility

- Concerns:
  - Costs & benefits of implementing system
  - Evaluation of project options
- Issues:
  - Technique. (to compare cost/benefit).
  - Selection. Which technical option to choose.
  - Decision (to stop/continue project).

### Categories of cost - statement 1

- Odd examples to save brainpower (if more in exam, brainstorm)

| Cost categories                     | Examples                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Hardware (HW) & Software (SW) Costs | Software<br />Dev. Tools                                     |
| Installation costs                  | New buildings<br />Preparation costs<br />Delivery charges   |
| Development costs                   | Feasibility study<br />System design & analysis<br />Implementation |
| Personnel costs                     | Salaries, benefits<br />Redundancy payments<br />Staff relocation |
| Operating costs                     | Utilities<br />Space costs<br />Standby arrangements         |

### Cost Statement 2

#### Capital Expenditure (One-off costs)

- Communications infrastructure
- Office furniture & accessories

#### Revenue/recurring expenditures (Recurring costs)

- Feasibility and analysis
- Support contracts
- Equipment's
  - Computer depreciation
  - Power
- Salaries and Wages

### Intangible Costs

- Learning curve costs
- Dysfunctional costs
- Opportunity costs
- Incompatibility costs

### Tangible/Quantifiable Benefits

- Reduce operating costs
- Better business control
- Reduce mistakes

### Intangible/Non-quantifiable Benefits

- Improve quality of customer service
- Greater reliability & security
- Faster response times

## Cost Benefit Summary

### Formatting

- X-axis: Year (year 0, year 1, ...)
- Y-axis: Costs/benefits, details (eg. : Hardware costs). Costs come before benefits

| COST BENEFIT SUMMARY (<- Title) |       |
| ------------------------------- | ----- |
|                                 |       |
| SUBTITLE (<- If necessary)      | Years |
| Costs:                          |       |
| Details on cost...              |       |
| Total costs:                    |       |
| Benefits                        |       |
| Details on benefits...          |       |
| Total benefits:                 |       |

Note: for money its best to be right-justified, and have 2 decimal places (regardless of whether there are cents), similar to a financial report.
