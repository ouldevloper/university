# Tutorial 3: System Analysis - Fact Gathering

## Question 1

A major project is currently about to enter the Requirements Analysis stage where managers, operators and customers will be asked about their requirements for the new system. The project team is currently reviewing the fact gathering techniques available for identifying, prioritising and agreeing to these requirements.

(a) Briefly describe THREE (3) advantages of interviewing users, particularly at their workplace, to determine their requirements.

> First advantage is **overcome resistance**. Interviews obtains the cooperation of the people involved.
> Second advantage is **body language**. Interview allows the analyst to observe the tone of response & body language to obtain more implicit information.
> Third advantage is **clarify facts**. Interviews allow the interview to verify and clarify confusing facts.

(b) Briefly describe three circumstances where questionnaires are an appropriate method of investigating users’ requirements.

> **Large amount of users**. Insufficient time to interview all possible users of system.
> **Geographically distributed users**. Time-consuming and expensive to interview users spread out over a wide area.
> **Anonymity**. Useful when provider of information wants to remain anonymous.

(c) Explain how a prototyping technique can be used to help users define their requirements to the analyst.

1. Quick information.
2. Identify weakness or possible errors of the system earlier.
3. Easy to change, help to clarify details.

(d) An analyst is planning an interview with a user about his requirements for a new system. He has identified the participants in the interview. Briefly describe THREE (3) other aspects that should be included in the interview plan.

- Interview questions
- Interview objective
- Interview details
  - Location
  - Time
  - Duration

## Question 2

A software system is to be developed to automate various operations of a library in an institute of higher learning. This system will cover various functions including, borrowing, returns, fines, reservations, renewing, browsing, searching and querying facilities. It will be used by the library staff, book borrowers and readers.

For the facilities mentioned above, identify and describe THREE (3) most important non-functional requirements.

> **Archiving, backup and recovery requirements**. The library system must be able to anticipate future failure or corruption to ensure that the most recently usable copy of the book data can be retrieved and restored in case of any problemss.
> **Usability requirements**. The system should be user-friendly, efficient, and have safeguards from errors to ensure the librarians who have weaker computer skills can easily get comfortable with the system.
> **Reliability**. The system should be able to process library transactions with nonexistant errors and proper error mitigation built-in to ensure that all transactions can be made smoothly.

## Question 3

“Interviews and questionnaires are two of the popular fact finding techniques used to understand users’ requirements during the analysis phase.” Discuss TWO differences between these two techniques.

> **Presence**. Interview requires both the interviewer and the interviewee to be present for the process to be undertaken. Questionnaire only requires the presence of the person receiving the form to be done.
> **Cost**. Interviews can be very time-consuming, and therefore very costly in terms of manpower. Questionnaires on the other hand do not require a staff to facilitate the process, making it cheaper.
