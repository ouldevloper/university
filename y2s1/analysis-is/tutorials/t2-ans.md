# Tutorial 2: Answers

## Question 1

The Computer Science Society (CCS) holds examinations for its members all over the world. The
examination is held every six months for some 300,000 students in 500 centres in 80 different
countries.

Current System

Currently, all answer booklets collected from the different centres around the world are sent by
courier service to the head office located in New York. In New York the booklets will be selected and
sent (by courier service) to different markers. As soon as the booklets are marked, they will be
returned to the head office in New York. The booklets will be checked before being entered into a
computer system.

Proposed System

Because of the high cost of operation of the present system and the long time taken to announce the
results, the management of the CCS is planning to implement an Online Marking System (OMS). In
this new system, the answer booklets are scanned in New York. The markers will be then given access
to the digital documents and the OMS for online marking.

(a) Briefly explain what is meant by technical feasibility.

> Technical feasibility specifies the hardware, software and perforamnce requirements of the system under study. Besides that, technical feasibility also evaluates whether the above requirements are technically feasible.

(b) Describe two technical issues that are likely to be considered in the OMS feasibility study.

> **Number of users.**: Because the examination halls are distributed globally, the system must be able to support multiple user simultaneous input, and this might be an issue across long distance.
> **Data inputs.**: Because the examination is entered on different places at once, there might be issues with data accuracy, integrity, and reliability.

(c) Briefly explain what is meant by operational and social feasibility.

> Operational and social feasibility assess whether the project can fit into the existing social and operational structure of the organization.
> Besides that, social and operational feasibility also identifies any additional costs that may be incurred or new benefits

(d) Describe two operational or social feasibility issues that are likely to be considered in the OMS feasibility study.

> **Employee Skills**: The OMS system will require new technical skills and attitude from the person who key in the marks. This might pose a problem especially in non-IT departments, who are not adept in using computers.
> **Employee motivation and resistance**: Some of the employees are fully satisfied with the current way of processing the answer booklets, changing it might cause some resistance, conflict, and employee turnover even if the new OMS system can bring new benefits.

(e) List THREE (3) costs and THREE (3) benefits that you would expect to see in the assessment of the economic feasibility of the OMS. Actual values are not required, just broad headings.

- Costs:
  - Hardware and software costs
  - Installation costs
  - Development costs
  - EXTRA - Personnel costs
  - EXTRA - Operating costs
- Benefits:
  - Increase revenues
  - Reduce costs
  - Better business control

(f) From the case study above, identify TWO (2) potential reasons for system requests and TWO (2) types of services requested.

1. Potential reasons for system requests
   1. **Directives from top managements** to improve existing system.
   2. **Existing system.** Errors or inefficiencies within existing systems.
2. Types of services requested
   1. **Improved performance**. Current system performance might not be satisfactory.
   2. **Better service.** Improving service to customers or end users.

## Question 2

The starting point for most system projects is called system request, which is a formal way in asking for IT support. Briefly explain any TWO (2) reasons for system request by an organization's top management?

Reasons:

- **Need new or additional information**
  - The management might require additional information to plan for strategic decisions.
  - An example is customer average rating on products
- **New management (or style)**
  - The new management might want to implement their own way of managing
  - An example is conversion from offline to online business.
- EXTRA - **Meet a new organizational objectives (such as increased sales)**
- EXTRA - **New activity in the business**

## Question 3

A supermarket is planning to implement a new POS system for its new and modern premises which it is moving to.

(a) List THREE (3) tangible benefits of using this system from the point of view of the supermarket.

Tangible benefits:

- **Reduced operating costs**
- **Reduced staff costs**
- **Increased sale revenue**

(b) List THREE (3) tangible benefits of using this system from the point of view of the customers.

Tangible benefits (customers point of view):

- **Decreased purchase price**
- **Reduced mistakes**
- **Improved productivity**

(c) List TWO (2) intangible benefits of using this system from the point of view of the supermarket.

- **Faster response time**
- **Better image**
- **Improved quality of customer service or satisfaction**

(d) Identify THREE (3) non-functional requirements for a POS System.

- **Data integrity**
- **Data retention**
- **Fault tolerance**
