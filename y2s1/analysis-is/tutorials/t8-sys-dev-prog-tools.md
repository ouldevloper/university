# ADIS Tutorial 8 - System Dev. - Prog. Tools

## Question 1

a. Maximizing cohesion makes the instructions in the module **jointly accomplish a single task**. This makes the program **more well structured**. Minimizing coupling r**educes the degree of dependence between the modules**. This prevents a bug in one module from **infecting another module**, and reduce the need to **modify multiple functions to resolve one issue** due to side-effects. Both of this leads to a more maintainable program.

Attribute 1: **Modularity**, the program is broken down into smaller pieces. They are independent of each other, which makes it easier to maintain the system.

Attribute 2: **Suitability/Choice of programming language**. The choice of programming language will make the program easier to make and maintain. If a bad choice is taken, it might be difficult to expand and maintain the system. (Example: Choosing Assembly language to make a pie chart, GG.com.my)

Attribute 3: **Design simplicity.**  The design of the system will influence system maintainability.  Simpler, straightforward systems are easier to maintain compared to complex systems. 

(b) Points, remember to explain them.

1. **Easier to maintain.**
2. **Lower barrier of entry, easier to understand**
3. **Easier to perform testing.**
4. **Easier to communicate with each other** (On system)

## Question 2

a. CASE tool is **Computer Aided Software Engineering tool**. It is a software that improves the efficiency of analysts in developing and maintaining the system.

Extra Points:

- Makes it easier for software design and development.
- Helps to automate various tasks.
- Improves the quality of software development.
- Improves the speed of development.

b. Points

- CASE tools makes it **easy to draw models**. Standard shapes are provided. 
- CASE tools makes it **easy to store models**. This allows subsequent retrieval and amendment. 
- CASE tools **makes it easy to update models**. They can be easily edited, updated, and reprinted.

c. 

1. Draw descriptive diagrams. Eg. DFD & ERD.
2. Producing and maintaining diagrams
3. Enforcing adherence to development standards.
4. Maintaining data dictionary.
5. EXTRA: Prototyping.
6. EXTRA: Generating Computer Codes.

Lecturer answer:

1. Share models & diagrams
2. Allow cross-referencing between materials
3. Everything can be stored inside a central data dictionary
4. Generating computer codes
5. Design user interface / screens for input/output.
