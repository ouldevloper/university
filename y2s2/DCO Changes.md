### Finding Companies

**Date**: 22/10/2019 (AKA The date after the announcement).

**Time**: 9.30AM-5PM

**Procedures:**

1. The day before, check out all the participating companies, take note of:
   1. Their location (unless you have your own private jet)
   2. Their business (shady = avoid)
   3. Their job openings
2. Make a list of prospects for the next day
3. On recruitment day, immediately start on those 'targeted companies', do whatever you need to get in 'the list'.
   1. DO NOT immediately accept offer. Look around first. Last thing you want is to get into a suboptimal company.
4. After done all those targeted companies, check out your 'untargeted list'.
5. Finish your day off by talking to some random duds and company people. Most of them are pretty open to chit chat. Their life cannot get more boring already, so just go ahead and talk to them.
