    - Buildings (go floor-by-floor)
    - Person/Places
- Topical order
  - Main points divided into logical & consistent subtopics
  - Divide based on categories/subject
  - Appropriate when subtopics can stand alone, such as:
    - Features, Benefits, Types, Implications, Achievements
- Causal / Cause-and-effect order
  - Main points show cause-effect / effect-cause relationship.
  - Patterns:
    - Cause-effect: Discuss cause before effect. (E.g.: AIDS)
    - Effect-cause: When effects take place first. (E.g. Effects of watching too many television)
  - Good for: 
    - Informative & persuasive speech
- Problem-solution order
  - Divided into:
    - The problem: Explain nature, extent, and seriousness of problem
    - Solution: Show how solutions will solve the problem
