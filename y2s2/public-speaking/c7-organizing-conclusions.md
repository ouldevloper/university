# 7. Organizing Conclusions

## Best way to end speech effectively

### Conclusion

- Ties speech together
- Do not introduce new ideas
- Give feeling of completeness
- Signals end of speech (Example: finally...)
- Reinforce central idea
- Make memorable final statement

### Crescendo Ending

- Conclusion building up to zenith of power & intensity
- Pitch & volume increase
- Often used by politicians

### Dissolve ending

- Generates emotional appeal
- Fading slowly to dramatic final statement
- Often used after winning awards

### Reinforcing central idea

- **Summarize** main points using different words/sentences
- End with **quotation**, acknowledge owner
- make **dramatic/exaggerated statement**
- Refer to **possible future action**

- Pose **challenge/question**

## Tips for preparing conclusion

- Look for possible concluding materials
- Conclude with **bang**, NOT a whimper. 
  - Bring voice up than drop
- Be brief: No more than 5-10% of speech
- Work out content & delivery while practicing

## Ways to end speech with a bang

- **Bookend Close**
  - Refer back to opening quote, and say: "We have arrived where we begin"
- **Challenge close**
  - Challenge audience to apply what is told in speech
- **Echo close**
  - **Focus on one word** in quotation (Example, raising voice/slowing down)
- **Repetitive close**
  - Find phrase & structure it in repetitive format, building to crescendo ending.
  - Eg:
    - Architects cannot renovate it
    - Businesses cannot incorporate it.
    - Only you can orchestrate it.
- **Title Close**
  - Give provocative title
- **Sing sing close**
  - Ask audience to repeat phrase
- **Callback close**
  - Refer to story you told earlier, but not completed
- **Movie close**
  - Make reference to well-known movie
- **Quotation close**
  - Use famous quotation to harness audience attention.
- **Third Party Close**
  - Use quotation to make message more exciting

## Common Problems to Avoid

- Don't apologize or make excuses
- Don't introduce new materials
- Don't conclude with "lastly, I conclude ..." or "that's all"
- Once signaled to finish, don't drag it past few sentences.
