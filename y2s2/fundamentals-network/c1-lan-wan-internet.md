## Components of a Network

### Categories

- Devices
  - End-devices / hosts - either sender / receiver
  - Interface with human & communications network
- Media
- Services

## Devices

### End Devices :computer:

- AKA hosts
- Form interface with human & communications network
- Uniquely Identified by address
- **Possible Question**: Question (5 end devices)

### Intermediary Devices :satellite:

- Devices along the way, carrying data to destination
- Benefits
  - **Link failure**: Alternate pathways
  - **Security**: Data filtering
- Examples:
  - Switches
  - Routers
  - Firewalls

## Services :globe_with_meridians:

- **Network service**: provide information for a request.
- Use **communication programs** running on networked devices
- **Services:** Network applications
- **Processes:** Provides functionality, or back-end for services

## Network Media 

- Pathway for data to transmit
- Each only accept specific encoding
- Examples:
  - Metallic wires
  - Glass/plastic fibers
  - Wireless transmissions

| Media       | Example              | Encoding              |
| ----------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Copper      | Twisted pair cable   | Electrical impulses   |
| Fiber-optic | Glass/plastic fibers | Light pulses          |
| Wireless    | -                    | Electromagnetic waves |

- Criteria:
  - Distance
  - Environment
  - Amount/Speed
  - Cost

## Network Representations

How to connect devices, media, and services together

### Network Interface Card (NIC) / LAN Adapter

- Provides physical connection between host devices & network

#### Physical Port

- Connector allowing connection between networking devices or hosts.

#### Interface

- Specialized ports on *internetworking devices* to connect to individual networking devices.

## Topology Diagrams

**Physical Topology Diagrams**: Identify *physical location* of devices, ports, and cables.

**Logical topology diagrams:** Identify devices, ports, IP addressing scheme.

## Types of Networks

- LAN
  - Network in a small geographical area
  - Interconnects end-devices
- WAN
  - Network in wide geographical area
  - Interconnects LAN over wide area
- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): 
  - Larger than LAN, smaller than WAN.
- WLAN (Wireless LAN) 
  - Wireless connection
- SAN (Storage Area Network)
  - Network infrastructure to:
    - support file servers
    - provide data storage, access, duplication
  - Involve servers, disk arrays, Fiber Channel interconnection

### Internet

- Worldwide collection of interconnected devices.

### Intranet

- Private connection of LANs/WANs in organization

### Extranet

- Provide secure & safe access of data to third-party.

## Trends of Computer Networking

- BYOD - Bring Your Own Device: Use personal devices to access
- Online Collaboration
- Video
  - Cloud computing: Storage of data, services/app in internet.
