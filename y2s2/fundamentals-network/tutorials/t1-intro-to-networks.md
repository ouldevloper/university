# T1: Intro to Networks

## Fundaments of Comp. Networks

### Question 1

1.  Networks and the Internet have changed the way we communicate, learn, work, and even play. Briefly discuss the networking impacts in our daily lives.  

   **Answer:**

   1. **Brought everything closer together.** Networking eliminates the problem of distance in our daily lives. Services thousands of kilometers away is fingertips away.
   2. **Redefining work efficiency.** Centralization of communication ensures work cohesion, speed, and quality.
   3. **Change of lifestyle.** Lifestyle becomes more sedentary as transportation becomes less mandatory for communication. Entertainment, work, communication becomes highly accessible.

2. Explain clients and servers network. Draw **ONE (1)** example of clients and servers network diagram by using proper network representations.  
   1. Clients and servers network refers to the delegation of roles inside a network depending on the software installed. The client will have software to primarily request and receive information. Whereas the servers will have software to primarily accept requests and provide information.
   2. ![](diagrams/t1/q1b.png)
   3. List **THREE (3)** advantages and **THREE (3)** disadvantages of using peer-to-peer networks.
      1. **Advantages**
         1. **Simpler**. No need for a network operating system
         2. **Much cheaper**. Does not require a dedicated server.
         3. **Fault tolerance**. If one computer fails, the network is still operational. Only files located on that computer will be unavailable.
      2. Disadvantages
         1. **Security concerns**. Aside from permissions, there are no security built-in. Users are fully responsible for ensuring the security of their content.
         2. **No centralization.** Multiple copies of the same data can be located in different places with different revision. Resources could be difficult to locate and update.
         3. **Separate user accounts.** Accessing resources from different computers will require the username and password of the computer, which are unique for each computer. 

### Question 2

1. Identify the **THREE (3)** categories of networks components and give **ONE (1)** example of each component

   | Component | Example                                                      |
   | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | Devices   | End Devices, Intermediary Devices, Personal Computer, Router Switch, Mobile Phones & other acceptable answers. |
   | Media     | Copper wire, Ethernet cable, Fiber Optic Cable, Wireless     |
   | Services  | E-Mail, VOIP, Internet Gaming, TCP/IP, Protocols & other acceptable answers |

2. Identify the following network representation (Note: Line means same as above, just markdown do not have row span)

   | Category             | Network Representation                                       | Name of the network representation |
   | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
   | End-devices          | ![img](../../fundamentals-network/tutorials/diagrams/t1/q2bn1.png) | Printer                            |
   | --------------       | ![img](../../fundamentals-network/tutorials/diagrams/t1/q2bn2.png) | IP Phone                           |
   | Intermediary devices | ![img](../../fundamentals-network/tutorials/diagrams/t1/q2bn3.png) | LAN Switch                         |
   | --------------       | ![img](../../fundamentals-network/tutorials/diagrams/t1/q2bn4.png) | Router                             |
   | --------------       | ![img](../../fundamentals-network/tutorials/diagrams/t1/q2bn5.png) | Wireless Router                    |
   | Network media        | ![img](../../fundamentals-network/tutorials/diagrams/t1/q2bn6.png) | Wireless media                     |
   | --------------       | ![img](../../fundamentals-network/tutorials/diagrams/t1/q2bn7.png) | WAN media                          |

3. Identify the type of network media, give each an example and the relevant encoding type.

   | Type of Network Media | Example           | Encoding              |
   | --------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
   | Copper                | Coaxial cable     | Electrical signals    |
   | Fiber-optic           | Fiber optic cable | Light signals         |
   | Wireless              | Air               | Electromagnetic waves |

## Question 3

1. Explain “network services” in the context of computer network.

   2. ANSWER: Services include many of the common network applications people use every day, like email hosting services and web hosting services.
   2.  ANSWER line 2: Processes provide the functionality that directs and moves the messages through the network. Processes are less obvious to us but are critical to the operation of networks.
       1.  Well, the reason why this is an important point, is because processes wrap around network services. They are the ones allowing a service to "reach outside".

2. Describe the term "Interface" and give ONE example. 

   1.**specialized ports** on **internetworking** devices to **connect to networks**. As an example, serial interfaces.

2. Distinguish between a physical topology and a logical topology

   1.  **Physical Topology Diagrams:** Identify **physical location** of devices, ports, and cables.
   2. **Logical topology diagrams:** Identify **presence** of devices, ports, IP addressing scheme.

3. Differentiate between LAN and WAN. 

   | LAN                                            | WAN                                     |
   | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
   | LAN interconnects **end-devices** in a network | WAN interconnects **LANs** in a network |
   | LAN covers a small geographical area           | WAN covers a wide geographical area     |

4. Distinguish between Intranet and Extranet.

   | Intranet                              | Extranet                                         |
   | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
   | Private connection in organization    | Public connection for third-party                |
   | Access restricted to a specific area. | Access restricted through VPN or access channels |
